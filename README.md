For examples on how to use this library, see the example package
(https://github.com/Shawckz/dankboard/tree/master/src/main/java/com/shawckz/dankboard/example)

The backend package is where all of the XScoreboard library is stores, which provides the base.

I suggest you look at XScoreboard.java and other classes in that package to get an understanding.

** PLEASE NOTE THAT ALL OF THE "DANK" IMPLEMENTATIONS ARE EXAMPLES.  FOR MOST USAGES, YOU WILL WANT TO CREATE YOUR OWN IMPLEMENTATIONS
OF 'XScoreboardLabel', 'XScoreboardTimer', 'XScoreboard', ETC! **

Most of the "dank" implementations are just examples, while you can use them; I suggest making your own implementations.

Example.java in the example package should help you get started - theres lots of comments in there.
ExamplePlayer.java is a simple player object wrapper wherein I am using it to store a Dankboard instance assuming that in that example
I am using a per-player scoreboard situation.

Enjoy
